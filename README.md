# contact-list-demo

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```

## Note

This demo is missing service call integration due to time constraints, so the service calls are stubbed. I did spend some time setting up the back-end before discarding it.

Here's what I finished:
 * Created MySQL DB on AWS and created table
 * Created AWS Lambda
 * Created AWS API Gateway and successfully tested against a test Lambda
 * I left off when I got hung up on wiring a Lambda to execute DB queries.
